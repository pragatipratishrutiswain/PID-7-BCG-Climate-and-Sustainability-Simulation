## Scenario for this program:
𝟏. I am working as a junior consultant at BCG’s Climate & Sustainability practice.<br>
𝟐. I am working on a project for an automotive client called Fast Cars.<br>
𝟑. My team includes Senior BCG leaders Lilly and Callie, who are highly experienced in the sustainability space and I’ll learn a lot by working with them.<br>
𝟒. I am hoping for a promotion at work, and this is an exciting opportunity for me to showcase my consulting skills and knowledge of the climate action space!<br>

## The brief from Fast Cars

### 💡 Business context for Fast Cars and why they have engaged BCG - 

- Fast Cars are under pressure from investors to address climate change.

- They also expect that new government regulations will force a phase out of Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) used in their cars.<br>
ICE is an engine which relies on burning petrol fuel or oil to make a car move and as we know, fossil fuels are bad for our environment 

- Fast Cars have set carbon emission reduction targets using the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), however they are still at the beginning of their emissions reduction journey. 

They have engaged BCG to advise them on how to deliver on their SBTi targets.

### 💡 What is the SBTi? 
(Source: SBTi)<br>

The SBTi is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi call to action is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments. 

Science-based targets show companies and financial institutions, how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent the worst effects of climate change.

## Fast Cars’ commitment to Net Zero
As part of their SBTi pledge, Fast Cars has committed to net-zero Scope 1 and 2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction by 2030 (from a 2018 base). Fast Cars has not committed yet to reducing its scope 3 GHG emissions but is considering doing so in the future.

First let’s understand the key terms below, then complete the quick knowledge check to move onto the next task.

## Net-Zero

This is when there is an exact balance between the amount of GHGs that are produced, and that are removed from the atmosphere.
In practice, this means that for every 1 ton of Carbon a company generates, they need to remove 1 ton from the atmosphere.
 
## Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions

This provides a great framework to understand a company’s GHG emissions, including where they are coming from and if they are direct or in-direct.

➡️Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions produced from operations controlled or owned by a company (e.g. GHGs created from burning fuel to operate manufacturing plants, furnaces etc.).<br>
➡️Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions that come from sources purchased by a company in order for it to operate (e.g electricity, or steam). So while a company might not produce electricity, it might rely on buying electricity to power an office or a manufacturing plant.<br>
➡️Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions produced in a company’s value chain (e.g. emissions generated by delivering, using, and disposing of a product). These activities are not controlled or owned by a company.<br>
 
This diagram provides a useful overview of Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.

🏆 Quiz
## 💡 True or False, to achieve Net Zero, Fast Cars will have to figure out a way to take more GHGs out of the atmosphere than they produce.
Ans - False<br>
Net Zero means that Fast Cars has to take the same amount of GHGs out of the atmosphere as they produce. If they take more out of the atmosphere, they would be considered Carbon Negative.

## 💡 True or False, Scope 3 emissions includes emissions generated from activities not controlled or owned by a company or purchased to power its operations.
Ans - True<br>
Scope 3 emissions refer to all emissions in a company’s external value chain.

## Fast Cars’ current emissions
My team leader, Lilly, has asked me to figure out the current emissions profile of Fast Cars.

This work would help the whole team to identify:

1️⃣ which parts of Fast Cars’ operations contribute the highest proportion of total emissions<br>
2️⃣ what the company will need to do to meet their targets.

A high-quality baseline is critical for this project.

## Figuring out the baseline
My task was to determine the emissions baseline for Fast Cars.

To do this I:

1️⃣ Downloaded the excel spreadsheet provided and added a new column to categorize each emission item as Scope 1, 2 or 3.

This resource helped me to categorize the emission scopes.<br>
https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-1-and-scope-2-inventory-guidance
 
2️⃣ Then, I created a summary table in the excel which adds up the emissions by Scope.
