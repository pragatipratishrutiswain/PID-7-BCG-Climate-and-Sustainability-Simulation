## Scenario for this program:
𝟏. I am working as a junior consultant at BCG’s Climate & Sustainability practice.<br>
𝟐. I am working on a project for an automotive client called Fast Cars.<br>
𝟑. My team includes Senior BCG leaders Lilly and Callie, who are highly experienced in the sustainability space and I’ll learn a lot by working with them.<br>
𝟒. I am hoping for a promotion at work, and this is an exciting opportunity for me to showcase my consulting skills and knowledge of the climate action space!<br>

## The brief from Fast Cars

### 💡 Business context for Fast Cars and why they have engaged BCG - 

- Fast Cars are under pressure from investors to address climate change.

- They also expect that new government regulations will force a phase out of Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) used in their cars.

- Fast Cars have set carbon emission reduction targets using the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), however they are still at the beginning of their emissions reduction journey. 

They have engaged BCG to advise them on how to deliver on their SBTi targets.

### 💡 What is the SBTi? 
(Source: SBTi)<br>

The SBTi is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi call to action is one of the We Mean Business Coalition commitments. 

Science-based targets show companies and financial institutions how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent the worst effects of climate change.
